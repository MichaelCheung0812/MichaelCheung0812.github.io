However, with the Fall of Eyrm, the world became an even playing field and no longer would humans agree to be subservient to the elven kingdoms. The coming of Auros and his great crusade toppled the elven hegemony and allowed great cities and nations of humans to flourish and dominate the mainland of Edriel. Now holding complete control of their own destinies, Mankind competes within itself while ensuring their dynasty as the rulers of Edriel remains."
                             data-raceinformation="The most politically powerful of all the races and by far the most numerous, humankind controls and administrates almost all of the Old World. Most humans follow what are known as the Aurosian faiths, the most common being the Golden Faith in the West and Huranism in the Orient. Though both churches hold considerable influence in their respective domains, most. if not all, temporal power is held by the independent empires and kingdoms, many of which do not restrain themselves from plotting or warring against their neighbors as is displayed by the numerous Oriental Wars. With their constant struggle and expansion, many humans could see Vynland as a place to get away from the troubles of the Old World or as a new land for conquest."

                            Humanity is the dominant race in Edriel, controlling much of its territory and being greater in population than the Elves or the Dwarves. Despite the sovereignty humanity holds over much of the known world, they are a people fractured by aeons old cultural and religious differences. It is humanity's natural instinct to quarrel that has historically prevented humans of the West and the Orient from expanding too far beyond their current borders. Yet, as quarrelsome as they are, humanity has achieved great heights nonetheless, and their mark on this world is inarguably significant.

                        data-racehistory="Though the elves were once the greatest and undeniably most dominant force in all of Edriel, that time has long passed. With the Fall of Eyrm, the Elrathyr were cut off from their deep connection to magic, and with the human uprisings the elves were expelled not only from dominance, but also from their own cities and lands. Now, with their ancient kingdoms turned to ash and rubble, the elves endure on within a world where they are now seen with prejudice and loathing by most of Edriel. Whether they live in segregated communities in human cities or as travelers seeking out the fabled last city of Tarial, it seems that it is the elven race’s destiny to endure even through hardship."
                        data-raceinformation="Known no longer as dominant race of Edriel, the Elrathyr, or elves, seem to only suffer misfortune since Eyrm’s fall. Many live in either segregated areas of human cities as to avoid prejudice and violence or choose a life of nomadic travelling, stopping wherever they are tolerated in hopes of laying down roots. Having no more nations or cities in which they rule, the only uniting factor is their reverence of their moon goddess, Anzus, and her largest following, the Lunar Church. With many Elves seeking to improve their downtrodden circumstances, Vynland seems to be a land of opportunity where the Elves may once again flourish freely or escape the shadow of their human overlords."
                        data-racephysiology="By far the longest lived of all races, the elves are known for their tall and lean builds. They are an agile race proficient in both dexterous acts such as running and climbing, as well as the usage of magic and spellcasting. Elves are often referred to as cat-like or reptilian for their narrow, slit pupils and angular features. ">

They built the foundation of many grand civilizations and cultures that have since fallen into the annals of history through war and conflict. To this day, the influence of their studies and magic remain in the old decrepit ruins of their past homes. These people now wander in search of a new home, laying down roots wherever their kind are tolerated. Whether within the uncharted wilderness or safely tucked into the vast urban cities of Mankind, they are only a shadow of their former greatness. Some of them seek to restore their race's power through either force or political intrigue, while others are content to assimilate into this new lifestyle of bustling business, agriculture and trade.

The Dorrin were a race disunited by civil conflict until an attempted invasion by the elven dominions. This attempted subjugation only worked to harden and strengthen their resolve and unity as a race. Bound under the ancient laws of the Dorraki-Kaz, the dwarves have remained willingly isolated from the rest of Edriel’s wars and troubles, choosing to work and improve their craft and magic rather than to expand and conquer. Though they are still divided by individual clans and kingdoms, they are a stalwart people who face the threat of the foreign world beside one another. "
                             data-raceinformation="Beneath the Four Kingdoms, the dwarves are said to possibly be the most advanced people and nations in the whole of Edriel. Unbothered by the catastrophes and turmoil that so often seems to rock the mainland of Edriel; the dwarves willingly choose to keep their kingdoms politically and geographically isolated from the other races. Known to be great craftsmen, mages and huntsman, they are treated with a level of respect unlike their other non-human counterparts. Vynland offers an opportunity of great wealth and untapped resources to the Dorrin that may be used to strengthen their influence as an individual or clan."
                             data-racephysiology="The shortest among the four races, the dwarves do not seem to pay any mind to their stature, as they are also undeniably the most sturdy and hardy of any race. They can be easily spotted out by the beards that their race often grows long and thick and by rough patches of stone skin that develop along their extremities. They are proficient spellcasters, and excel in any field of arcane study they attempt."

                            Dwarves, also called the Dorrin in their own tongue, are a race of short-statured humanoids native to the Northlands. They live within a vast hostile wilderness that is dotted by ancient stronghold-cities the dwarves call home. Though mankind and the Elrathyr have historically pressed to control the four dwarven kingdoms, any and all attempts to take the mountain fortresses that guard their homeland have failed spectacularly. The success of such defensive battles can be attributed to dwarven culture, their knack for masonry, and the ritualistic power of their seers. They remain deeply rooted in their culture and ancient lands to this day, unwilling to give up the place they call home to internal conflict or foreign adversaries.

Due to this, the scarce amounts of history recorded about this race of draconids are in the libraries of human or elven scholars. The myth of their origins is that they emerged from an ancient union between a woman of unknown origin and a dragon named Nar’lekk, though what is generally accepted is that this species of hulking lizards came out of the Askrae Desert and settled upon its rocky coast long ago."
                             data-raceinformation="Largely isolated within their own tribes and coastal settlements, the dragonkin embrace the idea of solitude far more than the dwarves far to the north. The dragonkin are small in population and have little to no communication with foreign nations or peoples. They universally embrace a dogma of peace and care only for the wellbeing of their own tribe. This tradition of reclusive pacifism rarely leads them out of the Askrae, but with the stirring of movement to Vynland, a number of them have taken to travelling across the sea and to this newly discovered island."
                             data-racephysiology="Towering above all other races, the dragonkin resemble upright draconids with their dense scales, heavy builds and long tails. They are a humanoid race believed to be descended from the legendary dragons of old, with reptile-like faces and snouts.

                            A mysterious people hardly recorded or referred to in history, the desert-dwelling ‘’’dragonkin’’’ are a race that are deeply nomadic, maintaining their peaceful ways. Sporting tall and biped dragon-like frames, the dragonkin are physically different from any other race and captivating in their many colours of scales and eyes. Outside of their homeland, few other races have met a dragonkin. Nobody knows what lies behind the effervescent and opalescent eyes of the dragonkin, but their odd perspective of the world, its history and the passing of time indicates to them being able to see some deeper, untold meaning to the universe. With their reverence to the souls and spirits of the departed, the dragonkin are shrouded in mystery, even, on occasion, to themselves.

                            The Golden Faith is based around the life and teachings of Auros. Auros first appeared in 3 AE in the Kingdom of Zoran where he performed great works and miracles. Wherever he went he promised great fortune and freedom from the Elves to those Humans who would agree to follow him. As his following grew larger and larger it eventually turned into a full scale crusade against the Elves to free Humanity and to wrest control of Edriel. This Great Crusade would continue on to defeat and vanquish every Elven city and kingdom in both the West and the Orient. In 198 AE the crusade was finished and Auros founded the city of Niros and the Nirosian Church to carry out his will. Since that day the Church led by the High Pontiffs have continued to lead the Golden Faith and carry out the Church’s will across Edriel.

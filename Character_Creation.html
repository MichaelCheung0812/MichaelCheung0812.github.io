                             data-racehistory="Before the Age of Golden Fire, humanity was known as a subservient race to the will of the Elven Dominion, forming tribes and acting beneath the will and demands of the Elrathyr. However, with the Fall of Eyrm, the world became an even playing field and no longer would humanity agree to be subservient to the elven kingdoms. The coming of Auros and his great crusade toppled the elven hegemony and allowed great cities and nations of humanity to flourish and dominate the mainland of Edriel. Now holding complete control of their own destinies, Mankind competes within itself while ensuring their dynasty as the rulers of Edriel remains."
                             data-raceinformation="The most politically powerful of all the races and by far the most numerous, humankind controls and administrates almost all of the Old World. Most humans follow what are known as the Aurosian faiths, the most common being the Golden Faith in the West and Huranism in the Orient. Though both churches hold considerable influence in their respective domains, most,if not all, temporal power is held by the independent empires and kingdoms, many of which do not restrain themselves from plotting or warring against their neighbors as is displayed by the numerous Oriental Wars. With their constant struggle and expansion, many humans could see Vynland as a place to get away from the troubles of the Old World or as a new land for conquest."
                             data-racephysiology="Neither the longest or shortest lived, nor the strongest or weakest, Humanity is truly the most versatile of all the races, giving homage to both those of strong and agile. To describe a human would be to try to describe a tall Dwarf or a strong Elf as both the elder races can often compare select features of Humanity as similar to some of their own."

                            Humanity is the dominant race in Edriel, controlling much of its territory and being greater in population than the Elves or the Dwarves. Despite the sovereignty humanity holds over much of the known world, they are a people fractured by aeons of old cultural and religious differences. It is humanity's natural instinct to quarrel amongst themselves that has historically prevented humans of the West and the Orient from expanding too far beyond their current borders. Yet, as quarrelsome as they are, humanity has achieved great heights nonetheless, and their mark on this world is inarguably significant. </p>

With the Fall of Eyrm, the Elrathyr were cut off from their deep connection to magic, and with the human uprisings the elves were expelled not only from dominance, but also from their own cities and lands. Now, with their ancient kingdoms turned to ash and rubble, the elves endure on within a world where they are now seen with prejudice and loathing by most of Edriel. Whether they live in segregated communities in human cities or as travelers seeking out the fabled last city of Tarial, it seems that it is the elven race’s destiny to endure even through hardship."
                        data-raceinformation="Known no longer as dominant race of Edriel, the Elrathyr, or elves, seem to only suffer misfortune since Eyrm’s fall. Many live in either segregated areas of human cities as to avoid prejudice and violence or choose a life of nomadic travelling, stopping wherever they are tolerated in hopes of laying down roots. Having no more nations or cities in which they rule, the only uniting factor is their reverence of their moon goddess, Anzus, and her largest following, the Lunar Church. With many Elves seeking to improve their downtrodden circumstances, Vynland seems to be a land of opportunity where the Elves may once again flourish freely or escape the shadow of their human overlords."
                        data-racephysiology="By far the longest lived of all races, the elves are known for their tall and lean builds. They are an agile race proficient in both dexterous acts such as running and climbing, as well as the usage of magic and spellcasting. Elves are often referred to as cat-like or reptilian for their narrow, slit pupils and angular features.">

They built the foundation of many grand civilizations and cultures that have since fallen into the annals of history through war and conflict. To this day, the influence of their studies and magic remain buried in the old decrepit ruins of their past homes. These people now wander in search of a new home, laying down roots wherever their kind are tolerated. Whether within the uncharted wilderness or safely tucked into the vast urban cities of Mankind, they are only a shadow of their former greatness. Some of them seek to restore their race's power through either force or political intrigue, while others are content to assimilate into this new lifestyle of bustling business, agriculture and trade.

The Dorrin were a race disunited by civil conflict until an attempted invasion by the Elven Dominion. This attempted subjugation only worked to further embolden and strengthen their resolve and unity as a race. Bound under the ancient laws of the Dorraki-Kaz, the dwarves have remained willingly isolated from the rest of Edriel’s wars and troubles, choosing to work and improve their craft and magic rather than to expand and conquer. Though they are still divided by individual clans and kingdoms, they are a stalwart people who face the threat of the foreign world beside one another."
                             data-raceinformation="Beneath the Four Kingdoms, the dwarves are said to quite possibly be the most advanced people and nations in the whole of Edriel. Unbothered by the catastrophes and turmoil that so often seems to rock the mainland of Edriel; the dwarves willingly choose to keep their kingdoms politically and geographically isolated from the other races. Known to be great craftsmen, mages and huntsman, they are treated with a level of respect unlike their other non-human counterparts. Vynland offers an opportunity of great wealth and untapped resources to the Dorrin that may be used to strengthen their influence as an individual or clan."
                             data-racephysiology="The shortest among the four races, the dwarves do not seem to pay any mind to their stature, as they are also undeniably the most sturdy and hardy of any race. They can be easily spotted out by the beards that their race often grows long and thick and by rough patches of stone skin that develop along their extremities. They are proficient spellcasters, and excel in any field of arcane study they attempt."

                            Dwarves, also called the Dorrin in their own tongue, are a race of short-statured humanoids native to the Northlands. They live within a vast hostile wilderness that is dotted by the ancient stronghold-cities that the dwarves call home. Though mankind and the Elrathyr have historically pressed to control the four dwarven kingdoms, any and all attempts to take the mountain fortresses that guard their homeland have failed spectacularly. The success of such defensive battles can be attributed to dwarven culture, their knack for masonry, and the ritualistic power of their seers. They remain deeply rooted in their culture and ancient lands to this day, unwilling to give up the place they call home to internal conflict or foreign adversaries. </p>

                             data-racehistory="The origin of the dragonkin is largely left up to myth and legend as the collective race itself hasn’t recorded their own history, even in oral tradition. Due to this, the scarce amounts of history recorded about this race of draconids are found only within the libraries of human or elven scholars. The myth of their origins is that they emerged from an ancient union between a woman of unknown origin and a dragon named Nar’lekk, though what is generally accepted is that this species of hulking lizards came out of the Askrae Desert and settled upon its rocky coast long ago."
                             data-raceinformation="Largely isolated within their own tribes and coastal settlements, the dragonkin embrace the idea of solitude to a far greater degree than the dwarves far to the north. The dragonkin are small in population and have little to no communication with foreign nations or peoples. They universally embrace a dogma of peace and care only for the wellbeing of their own tribe. This tradition of reclusive pacifism rarely leads them out of the Askrae, but with the stirring of movement to Vynland, a number of them have taken to travelling across the sea and to this newly discovered island."
                             data-racephysiology="Towering above all other races, the dragonkin resemble upright draconids with their dense scales, heavy builds and long tails. They are a humanoid race believed to be descended from the legendary dragons of old, with reptile-like faces and snouts. Each of the dragonkin tribes have developed their own unique scale colors, appearances and styles in clothing.">

                            A mysterious people hardly recorded or referred to in history, the desert-dwelling ‘’’dragonkin’’’ are a race that are deeply nomadic, maintaining their peaceful ways. Sporting tall and biped dragon-like frames, the dragonkin are physically different from any other race and captivating in their many colours of scales and eyes. Outside of their homeland, few other races have met a dragonkin. Nobody knows what lies behind the effervescent and opalescent eyes of the dragonkin, but their odd perspective of the world, its history and the passing of time indicates to them being able to see some deeper, untold meaning to the universe. With their reverence to the souls and spirits of the departed, the dragonkin are shrouded in mystery, even, on occasion, to themselves.</p>

                <p class="section-description">
                    In the center of the world lies the continent of Edriel, otherwise known as the Old World. Bordered to the north by the Dwarven Kingdoms and the Astra’s Edge Mountains and in the south by the Dragonkin Tribes of the Askrae Desert, the lands of Edriel are as diverse as they are vast. Whether you come from a hard life in the steppes of the Orient or from a prosperous one in the Republics of the Lascari, Edriel holds almost every kind of lifestyle and community that one could imagine.

                            The Golden Faith is based around the life and teachings of Auros. Auros first appeared in 3 AE in the Kingdom of Zoran where he performed great works and miracles. Wherever he travelled, Auros carried with him the promise of great fortunes and freedom from their Elven Overlords, to those Humans who would fall under his banner. As his following grew larger and larger it eventually turned into a full scale crusade against the Elves to free Humanity and to wrest control of Edriel. This Great Crusade would continue on to defeat and vanquish every Elven city and kingdom in both the West and the Orient. In 198 AE his crusade came to a close and Auros soon founded the city of Niros and the Nirosian Church upon its heels to forever carry out his will. Since that day the Church led by the High Pontiffs have continued to lead the Golden Faith and carry out the Church’s will across Edriel.

                        <p class="section-description-right">
                            Anzuism, alternatively known as the Celestial Church, is an elven faith centered around the worship of Anzus and the cosmos surrounding her. It is the oldest faith on Astra, and has persisted throughout time as one devoted to the history of the elves, their savior Anzus, and the continuation of the elven race. While the Anzan faith has dwindled in recent years, it's seen a sudden revitalization by the rallying of Vicar Vathylra. The faith of Anzuism promotes peace, but some of its followers have since taken to a more violent approach in restoring the grandness of their church and its followers. Anzuism is perceived by most as the antithesis to the Golden Faith, and has a long history of conflict with the zealous followers of the Church of Niros. Today, while the elves linger in the shadow of the humans who dethroned them so long ago, Anzuism remains a faith quietly practiced by the elven people under the shadow of the night sky. It's seen as a heretical faith by many humans, while the elves see it as the only faith worthy of regard.

                            Not strictly a single faith or dogma, Paganism moreso describes the congregation of local and nomadic faiths that still cover parts of the Old World as we know it. With local Gods still present in many cultures, particularly in the Orient, it is not rare to see paganistic beliefs being favored over the Golden Faith or Huranism, particularly amongst isolated communities. Many still hold hatred towards Auros, the god-killer, for the destruction of the old ways, even two millenia later. Although diverse, the Pagan faiths all share a common understanding of the value of nature and the very much influential divine beings that live in it’s welcoming arms. From the followers of the Great Whale of Wharos to the wolves of the plateau, several fierce cultures scorn to this day the monotheistic religions of the civilized world and staunchly fight to maintain their prized way of life.   </p>

                    <p class="section-description-right">
                        The first part of creating a character are basic choices such as race, culture, age and a character archetype that you want to play. While you should avoid pigeonholing your character, giving your character an archetype that is their niche creates more memorable and consistent themes.
<br><br>
                        <b>Race:</b> Pick a race that interests you and that you would like to portray. Optionally find more information about your chosen race on the wiki <a href="https://wiki.vynland.com/index.php/Races">Here</a>
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Culture:</b> If applicable, pick a culture for your character. Cultures help with the design of backstory, mindset and appearance.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Personality Traits:</b> Write a few keywords that you want your character to have. Think of things such as defining life moments, attitude and quirks that they may have.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Appearance: </b> Imagine your character and how you want them to look. Their physique, clothes, piercings and tattoos are examples of what you might imagine
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Flaws :</b>Describe your character’s flaws: Their fears, vices or concepts of anger. For newer players, taking fears and dislikes that you are familiar with as a person are not necessarily a bad thing.

                        Attributes are a character’s natural talents and aptitude. All actions taken fall under one of these categories. While this does not mean that a character is excluded from other walks of life, they do decide what they are generally good at.
                        <br>
                        In terms of mechanics, attributes determine how reliable your rolls are. An attribute of 1 gives you a standard roll, while an attribute of two gives you two rolls, where you may pick the highest one. An attribute of 0 means that you roll twice and pick the lowest die.
                        <br>Attribute points are decided from the start, and can not be gained.

Each skill falls under an attribute category, meaning that character’s have an easier time making use of their skills if they have the talent for it.

                            Through hard work, practice and studying one can improve their craft. Profession points represent a character's proficiency in a specific field. The range of proficiencies can be anything, but they must be aligned with a skill.
                            Profession points are very specific and can be wildly diverse. For this reason players are allowed to make up their own professions. Professions are divided in two: Minor and Major professions. Minor professions are hobbies and niche
                            talents that your character may have and serve to round your character. Major professions represent technique in major crafts that take years to hone and master. If you are unsure which category your profession falls beneath, please consult the official

                            Mechanically a character can continuously gain profession points, though gain increasingly little. They add a flat modifier to actions on top of character skills.

                    <h3 style="text-align: left">Creating a story</h3>
                    <p class="section-description-right">
                        After you have an idea of a character in your mind and know what you want to Roleplay you flesh out your character with a background.
                        A backstory is the connection to the world of Astra. They tie you to interests, events and bind you to other people's characters allowing for dynamic roleplay.
                        Writing a good backstory turns your character in more than numbers and gives them depth to immerse yourself into. <br>
                        <b>Make sure to not make your character too noteworthy or developed from the start.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        Your character has their own little world within the setting of Vynland, and it is encouraged to use some creativity to make up your own events and environment they grew up in.
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="text-align: left">Appeal to yourself</h3>
                    <p class="section-description-right">
                        It is important that the character you create is a character you can love. While often people insult the practice of creating a character that is wish fulfillment or too much like oneself, there is a fine balance that should be struck.
                        Being able to relate to your own character and liking to play them creates more enjoyable roleplay for yourself and the people you will roleplay with. Remember that every character is a living document, and their backstory can be expanded upon
                        as you go along.
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="text-align: left">Intractability</h3>
                    <p class="section-description-right">
                        The goal in Roleplay is being able to interact with other characters in interesting and fun ways. Often people believe that this is done by making their own character unique and by standing out. A better way to ensure that your character is interactable
                        is by sharing common traits. By having a rich backstory that may coincide with other character's you can create interactions that are not forced. Consider where your character originates from and how this might shape their opinions of others.

                    <p class="section-description-right">
                        <b>Childhood</b><br>
                        Every person is born in different circumstances in life. Where and how they were raised and in which segment of society greatly influences a character.
                        Creating the family and world they were born into is commonly the first step in a character's background. This also often determines what kind of education they had received (Or lack thereof)
                        and major or minor experiences they might have had as a child.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Teenage Years</b>
                        In the teenage years, one's talents and aspirations often become clear. The topics a character is interested in and the why's start to become evident. Often they find a mentor figure and find
                        a taste of the world. The personality traits of a character also start to surface in the teenage years. If your character receives training, this is where they usually start.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Adolesence and Adulthood</b>
                        During the coming of age and their first years as adults, character's often encounter major life changing experiences, and are greatly influenced by the world around them. Characters are often aware of their
                        strengths during this stage of life and often develop long term goals that they pursue as well. Think and write about their worldview and interactions with other people, or leave them as a more blank slate to be
                        filled in by their future experiences in Vynland.
